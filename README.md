# Hi! I'm Kenneth :wave:

### About me:

I stumbled on learning how to code from pure curiosity for it. I looked into freecodecamp and started doing their curriculum with the enjoyment of making minor movements to a page with just typing out the syntax. It was fun to me because I enjoyed typing anything. As I dove into JavaScript, thats where my interest for code skyrocketed! The code that I was writing started feeling like a puzzle, an escape room to be exact. Giving the computer a set list of instructions that will carry out task. In my eyes, this was similar to solving the small puzzles in an escape room to complete/escape the room. The enjoyment from completing features or solving hard bugs was comparible to finally having a breakthrough in a puzzle. Tt could be the most infuriating bug, but at the end it is just so satisfying to finally get over that bump in the road.
